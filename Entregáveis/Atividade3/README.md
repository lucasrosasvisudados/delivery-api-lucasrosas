# Delivery API

![Project Banner](IMAGE_URL_HERE)

This project is a RESTful API for managing restaurant and delivery services. Built with Java and the Spring Framework, it provides a robust backend solution for handling orders, menu management, customer information, and delivery logistics. The API follows modern development practices and leverages Spring Boot's powerful features for rapid development and easy deployment.

The project uses Java as its core programming language, taking advantage of its strong typing, extensive ecosystem, and enterprise-grade reliability. Spring Framework provides dependency injection, data persistence with Spring Data JPA, and RESTful web services through Spring MVC, making it an ideal choice for building scalable and maintainable microservices architecture.
